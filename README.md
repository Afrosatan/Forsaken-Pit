Forsaken-Pit
============

Game created for Ludum Dare 29!

Web based, html/css/js/AngularJS with Java/JAX-RS webservices and postgresql backend.

You are a guy with a gun and and run around underground killing monsters or other players.
It's multiplayer, and there are leaderboards.

The game is no longer deployed.

How To Play
============
First, create a new character at the top of the page - enter a name and pick a color (the color only changes the insignia on your suit).

Your character will be in the middle of the map, click anywhere on the map and you will get a popup with the options for what you can do.
You can move anywhere, you can attack monsters and players, you can click on yourself and rest which restores health.
When you attack enemies you get 1 point, and if you kill them you get 5 more points.
Every 50 points you get gives you additional firepower and max health.
Points put you on the leaderboard.
How much damage (firepower) you do and how much health you have is on the right.
There aren't any animations unfortunately, so you can pay attention to the messages/events on the bottom of the screen.

There are 2 monsters/npcs right now:
The Ogre is melee and has more health.
The Laser Slug is ranged.

The world is 50x50 and repeats, I meant to add stairs leading to deeper levels with tough monsters for the theme, but didn't have time.
